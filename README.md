# Monuments-Gallery-Webpage
Heritage Haven is a simple web application that allows users to manage a collection of monuments. Users can add new monuments with details like name, description, and city. Clicking on a monument image opens it in edit mode for updating details, while a delete button below each monument allows easy removal. A search feature helps filter monuments by name for quick access.

This project provides an intuitive interface for monument management. The top navigation includes an “Add” button for new entries and a “Search” button for filtering. Users can interact seamlessly with the gallery to edit or delete monuments as needed. Built using HTML, CSS and Javascript
